__label__0 "this would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf . the material is so soft and luxe . the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything . but the attached scarf ruins everything ! ! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front . if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat . so disappointing ."

__label__-1 "i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack . it was quite comfortable and did n't look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering . when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie . i do n't do form-fitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way . it 's got to go back ."

__label__0 "really wanted to like this top . the model has it on backwards - the v is actually the back and closes with an eye hook ( that is where the tag is ? there 's also a seam running down the back ) . the front is actually a high round neck . the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap . i 'm usually a s or xs . in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely . the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up ."

__label__-1 "this top was just not flattering . i 'm 5 ' 8 and medium build and the m was very bulky and the fabric did n't fall in the right places . made me look very round and i 'm not so it 's definitely going back !"
__label__1 "for cat lovers in particular these socks will grab your attention . they are fine quality ankle socks . the kittens are really more moss green than beige ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews . the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh . it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i 've every tried on at retailer . i 'm 5 ' 4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume ."
__label__1 "this looks just as pictured . it 's comfortable but dressy . i love it !"
__label__0 "i had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it was n't worth it . i got an xs and it was quite baggy . i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is . for someone who 's bigger i 'd definitely check this shirt out ."

__label__1 "i bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it 'll do just fine ! it 's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light but substantial enough that i do n't fear snagging it constantly . the cloth has a nice weight and drape and while the fit is on the loose side it does look intentional . wonderful as a pullover or by itself . i have the minty blue-green color and it 's divine . definitely worth the price ."
__label__0 "the dress is precious and looks good on all body types . however the bust is extremely tight . i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area ."
__label__1 "love this dress . great lightweight fabric bold colors and lined to the knee . the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth but it breaths well so it does n't add extra heat . i found it ran true to size and it 's a good length for tall girls . i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back . looks great on it 's own or dress it up with a statement necklace . there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement . great find ."
__label__0 "i ca n't believe how small these are . i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly . these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them . the rise in the crotch is also very short . very full in the legs and one is longer than the other : ( the stripes do n't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price !"

__label__1 "girls this dress is gorgeous . but if you are an a/b cup there is just too much fabric in the bust . the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number . alas i had to send it back and was very sad to do so ."
__label__1 "i felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes . i am long lean and broad shouldered . i normally wear a m but ordered a l. it still fits snug so i 've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape as pictured on the model . material and color of the red motif is darling ; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer ."

__label__-1 "the front cream panel is completely transparent.i did n't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath . i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through ."
__label__-1 "lovely colors and print . my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side ( it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely ! ) and worse the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread which showed through the sheer netting layer on top . for the price this particular detail should have been addressed ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to love ... but ... the way it fit .. lower part a tad too flowy ... almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed ! despite my bra size being a modest 36b ... the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare ... such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just did n't work me ."
__label__0 "do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub . i think with this top the styling is key . the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this was n't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go . anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that did n't seem to be static prone"
__label__-1 "i wanted to like this top as the fabric was nice and thick but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape but i 've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy ( and i 'm not heavy ) . not great enough to keep in my opinion ."

__label__0 "this top has a lot of potential ( comfortable easy to wear ) but it 's cut too small in the area above the bust . i tried the top in small medium and large ( i usually wear s or m in retailer tops ) and could n't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling . you can see it on the model too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole . i think you 'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom . i tried the green in the sto"

__label__-1 "i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person . the fabric is a rough gauzy texture . the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body . also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off . sadly these are going back ."
__label__0 "i 'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations . it 's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt . unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short ( it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach ) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you ( accentuating your stomach and ma"

__label__-1 "first let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress . but the fit is extremely loose . they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress . the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate . if it was i would love this dress . the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline . i am 5 ' 7"
__label__1 "okay so in terms of quality i 'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $ 18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop ' store but i do love them . the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering . i found that they did run a little large but could n't size down so i hope they do n't stretch out .

__label__0 "i really love this top but am afraid i may need to return it because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it and they show really badly as black spots because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads . it feels so good on though ! you must be super careful with it . i have no idea how the little snags even got there !"

__label__-1 "i fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it ! unfortunately when i went to put it on there was a hole running down the seam in the back . i went to store to exchange wore the shirt and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt . horrified i went home took a look both holes along the seam ! i will be returning this i really liked this shirt !"
__label__0 "i got this as a gift and one for me . the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i 'm 6 ' 1 and it was large enough but so short waisted . i would n't recommend it for women over 5 ' 7"
__label__0 "snags very very easily . i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged ! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top lovely color and beautifully detailed ! i 'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back ."
__label__0 "i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun . however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me . the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee ) .the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off . there are no zippers or buttons . getting it on is easy not so when taking it off !"
__label__1 "i love this skirt wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so ( when i saw it was almost sold out in my size which it is now ) . another thing is it does n't come in petite - boohoo . anyway ordered the 0 ( smallest size ) for my 26.5 in waist - did n't have any trouble with the waist being too tight like some other reviewers . it fit really well and comfortably . sits at the natural waist so the hem is n't too crazy low on me . fine for heels ( would be so cute"
__label__-1 "i am not sure who would look good in this dress . it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone !"
__label__-1 "bought this cami/tank on sale which i 'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted .. it kinda just drapes under the cami ... the problem is it 's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ... but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest .. so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment ... it simply looks awkward ... not sure if it would 've been better"
__label__0 "i received the moss skirt today . the material felt very soft and like good quality . i 'm 5 ' 4 ' 125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular . unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long below the knees . the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides . possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss . plus i 'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed that might be the cut of the skirt . it did n't work for me and i will be returning"

__label__0 "tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split so any movement reveals most of your arm shoulders . which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office ( yes i could wear a sweater or blazer with it but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top . ) why retailer ? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc . but the split sleeves make it a no-go ."
__label__1 "i buy everything that retailer sells in chambray . this top did not disappoint . it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing . the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying . i am not big busted so i did n't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have ."

__label__0 "i really liked the style of this top but it 's way oversized ! i 'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs . the material is nice but i ca n't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big . this one is going back to the store !"

__label__-1 "this blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off . just odd . sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received . mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white . no ruffle . returned ."
__label__0 "this top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things . it was a bit short for me as i have a long torso but i wish it had fit right !"

__label__-1 "i love this top ( so cute and comfy ! ) but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to dry ..... now there are 2 small holes in the front . for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable . very disappointing especially since i do n't live near an retailer and ca n't take it back easily ......"
__label__-1 "saw this on line and decided to splurge for the holidays . arrived today and is going right back . runs very small especially in the waist . trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper . fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture appears cheap and very itchy . sooooo disappointed ."

__label__0 "these pants are cute . they seem to me to have a wider leg than appears on the model . they do run big so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt . these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down but unfortunately look pretty sloppy by the end of the day as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly . since they already run a bit big this is a major negative . i wore them to church and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home . by late afternoon they looked like a different pair of pants ."
__label__1 "while overall it 's a pretty top there were a few surprises . the biggest one not listed is that the bottom has a thin elastic band ! without it the top would be wide longer and flow . in the picture to get it to the length shown the elastic is pulled up toward the waist . which could work for some as you can adjust the length into a tucked in look . it could be cut off and sewn making a normal flowy top . i am a normal size 6 and the shoulders are off and the sleeve length is long with elastic"
__label__0 "this dress is very good quality with beautiful beading on the bodice . it 's a heavier material than i was expecting but that was a pleasant surprise . unfortunately when i put it on and looked in the mirror i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid . the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and combined with the overall design and length i could n't think of anywhere to wear it . this is an easy return for me . the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit"
__label__-1 "i loved the colors ( especially the pink ) and thought this would be really pretty . however when i received it its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it . i also found it huge . normally i wear an xxsp or a 00p ( for reference i am 5 ' 2 30e and 24 in waist . i tried both the xxsp ( fit better but was too short ) and the xxs ( too large ) . i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted but its definitely not ."

__label__0 "yes it 's a swing top just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season . i find this silhouette unflattering on me being top heavy so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house . it also runs huge with big gaping arm holes . the sleeves are cute and fluttered . the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer . it is a pretty boxy top which the photo does n't seem to capture . order at least a size smaller than usual ."
__label__0 "i loved the look of this shirt but when i put it on it was entirely too billowy under the chest . it just ended up making me look larger and pregnant ."
__label__-1 "i had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric ... it 's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse . will be returning it ."
__label__0 "i love love love this absolutely stunning dress . the only problem was that the zipper was very difficult to maneuver and when it finally went up the watch it was attached the lining of the dress made a bump in the dress which was very unflattering on an otherwise very flattering dress . i tried on multiple versions of this dress and had the same design issue with each . i ended up returning it because it bothered me so much ."
__label__-1 "much lower quality than other robes i have purchased"
__label__1 "i love this top and it 's so pretty in person . knew it would be full but was hoping it would n't be too big . it 's perfect and looks good with jeans ."

__label__0 "this is a very fetching little dress but the details of the fit as described by other reviewers is slightly off . i am 34d 5 ' 5 and 140 lbs . the top fits perfectly but has an odd gap at the button placket . the fabric is nice enough but not exactly as i expected . one must have a very flat stomach as the top of the dress is not forgiving at all . the dress just was n't me i guess so this one is going home to retailer ..."
__label__1 "i purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation . it 's such a cute fun print . i purchased my regular size xs and it 's a good fit . the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it . got it during the 25 percent promo .."

__label__-1 "i am a 32dd 5 ' 4 '' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy . it looked awful . this is shapeless and oversized . i would size down or just pass ."
__label__-1 "this was so boxy and unflattering . i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag . was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit . sizing down would not help this one . went back !"
__label__0 "the smallest size xs was big on me i was overwhelmed by the sweater . it is a bit of swing shape does n't hug the body . sleeves are interesting though but not flattering on a petite frame . color is a pretty green made me think of wintergreens . fabric may be itchy to some . just ok for me . for reference xs bog on 115 lbs 30dd 26.5 in waist ."

__label__-1 "i loved these pants . they fit perfectly . and then i washed them . like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them . the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns . so sad . wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right ?"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan . unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach . the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger . the quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this dress but it just was n't flattering on me . i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way ( sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman ) but it was pretty shapeless on me . it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it . might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless but it did n't work for this short"

__label__0 "the fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it . my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm so if you are n't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm it will show ... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders"
